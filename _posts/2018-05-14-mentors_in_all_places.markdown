There is no rule that says you can only have one mentor in your life.  It makes a huge difference to have several.  You can find mentors with different areas of expertise, different schedules, and mentors that belong to different networks.

Meetups can be a good place to find people willing to share their time and wisdom with you.  I have also had luck finding people in Facebook tech groups.  The good thing about both platforms is it allows you to search based on geographic area, type of technology, and cultural identity.  Finding a mentor who has faced the same challenges you are about to face is invaluable.

I've also stayed in touch with former coworkers and supervisors.  People who are passionate about technology will continue to educate themselves.  It helps keep up your level of motivation and excitement to talk to others that are still learning and growing.

Be open to help from different sources and you will find a good group of mentors.
