Do you remember the exercise in grade school where you have to help the teacher make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich? 

You provide the teacher with the steps to follow, and they basically make a mess on their desk because no matter what you say the steps are in the wrong order or you have skipped crucial steps.  It is supposed to teach you the importance of clear instructions.

Then there are those trick questions on exams that give you too much information.  If you think everything is important, then you pick the wrong answer.  It's supposed to teach you to take what you need and leave the rest behind.

These lessons came in handy when I began programming in BASIC.  Yes, BASIC.  I was the fastest in my class, which meant I could take extra time to carefully rip the sides off my dot matrix paper before turning in my assignments.

I was born a programmer.

It isn't something I know because of grades, because honestly I don't remember how I scored on those early assignments.  It isn't something I know because I received accolades from a boss, or have the awestruck admiration and acceptance from peers in software development, since I have not had the fortune of experiencing either of those things.  
I don't wear hoodies, didn't graduate from an Ivy League university, and I don't have Stark arrogance.

Whether people want to call it programming or development or engineering, I do it because it's part of me.  When I'm writing code it feels like one of my senses.  It's as natural as breathing.

I always feel like I'm just starting to learn.  I feel like an outsider.  Dreams of doing this everyday without feeling like I'm goofing off don't seem real yet.  Someone will pay me for this?  I will be good at this one day?  Maybe.  Who knows.  

I'm not giving up though.  One day I will build robots.  I will build HAL.  All of my nerdy self-tickling weird ideas will come to life because I will finally learn how to summon them from these keys.   

The kid perfecting the pb&j algorithm demands I take this path.
