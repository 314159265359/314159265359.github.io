While passing tests and getting the "green light" to move on is a good feeling, sometimes failing tests is the best way to learn.  I find that making errors on purpose helps to understand the WHY which helps me retain the HOW.

In the real world, it works the same way.  We gain confidence in doing things once we have made a few mistakes on the road to mastery.  Once when I was learning to roller blade, a friend suggested I fall on purpose to get over the fear of falling.  So, I did.  I fell a few times, landing in different ways - on my arms pads, on my knee pads, and then the scary un-padded fall.  After my body learned what falling felt like, it didn't panic when I fell accidentally.  

Although I first started the web development course wanting to get all green lights on labs, and all perfect scores on quizzes, now I fail tests on purpose.  I move on when I feel comfortable.  It takes time to get the balance right, after all it isn't good to go to the other extreme and get sucked into analysis paralysis.  You could probably tweak a method for weeks on end, but deadlines are important too.  

By the end of this course I expect to get the balance right.  I will have the confidence to break things, make mistakes, and the efiifciency and good judgment to know when to commit code and move on in a timely manner.
