When I applied for the POCIT scholarship, I was told by someone at Flatiron School that there weren't many applicants.  This may be due to not reaching the intended audience, it could also be due to potential applicants feeling discouraged.

One day I saw a woman talking about her book on microaggressions.  It was clear to me that she had never experienced microaggressions, or even knew what it was.  Most of the audience was agreeing with everything she said.  She was applauded.  She was selling books.

I've worked in places that struggled with diversity.  They have homogeneous staff and management.  They may try to have diversity events, or even hire a Diversity Manager/Director.  Yet, they fail to nurture a diverse workforce.  Much has been written about this being a particular challenge in STEM fields.

Why would organizations think they can achieve diversity with a panel of clones?  If you create a cult of people who look and think like each other, how do you think they will treat someone who is different?  The resume is screened out for having a weird name, or an unfamiliar school or "too different" path of learning.  Then the person is screened out based on appearance or accent.  The interview process filters out anyone who does not fit in with the CULTure.  If by some miracle they do make it through the code-switching gauntlet, and can start the job, they are watched carefully for any signs of non-conformity, and quickly pressured out.  Any mistake or flaw is magnified where it would be forgiven if they were a member of the "normal" race.

Let's be honest.  Diversity has to start at the top.  More people, not clones, who own businesses and found organizations.  More people who have access to resources so that they can learn STEM subjects.  More people who have their inventions and solutions shared with the world.  

By excluding people, and condemning them to poverty, we are hurting everyone.  

To the bootcamps out there - you are lying to yourselves if you think a scholarship is inclusive if you do not provide funds to cover living expenses.  You are lying if you screen people out based on geography, age, experience level, and ability to pay a "deposit" to show we are "serious".  You are lying if the scholarship comes with conditions that do not allow for limited internet access, having to borrow a computer, or having to stop the course at times due to illness or unforeseen circumstances.  You are lying if you cannot help secure employment.  Taking a course for months, with no income, and no guarantee of a job is an impossible gamble when you are poor.  For POC, breaks in employment on your resume is an excuse used to screen us out during the job application process.  No one cares if you stopped to take a course or do self-study or find yourself.  That only works if you are privileged.

Ownership.  Our ownership.  That is the only way we will achieve diversity.
