One thing I don’t like about online coding tutorials is how they can lull you into programming along with the course.  You follow every step, the program works, and you move on.  Then when you need to use those “skills” later, you can’t remember anything.

On the job, it is easy to remember challenges.  When you have deadlines, have done research, and have had several meetings to hammer through something, only for it to fail...you tend to remember what works and what didn’t.

With Flatiron School, the focus so far has been test-driven development.  This is a welcome change from the abundance of free auto-pilot online tutorials.  When I run the tests I can see why they fail, and better understand how and why the program is supposed to work.  This is much closer to the actual work experience I’ve had in the past.  It seems we are also going to learn to write our own tests as we proceed through the course.  This is an amazing advantage to have when returning to the world of work.  I am excited to be able to tell a potential employer that I know how to write tests!  This makes you think of how to approach a problem, and plan for edge cases, before you start writing code.

Planning and debugging should take more time than writing code.  I wish more bootcamps and schools would allow students to think through problems and learn from errors.
